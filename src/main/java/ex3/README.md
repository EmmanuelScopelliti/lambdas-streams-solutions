## Exercise 3: Messy streams

Streams are a good technique for writing clearer and concise code. If they are misused, however, stream pipelines can become just as cryptic as "normal" code. See, for instance, the stream pipelines in the [`MessyStreams`](MessyStreams.java) class.

Your goal in this exercise is to decipher and rewrite these pipelines to make them easier to understand, while keeping their original behavior.

Keep in mind that your new pipelines should still pass the unit tests in [`MessyStreamsTest`](../../../test/java/ex3/MessyStreamsTest.java).
